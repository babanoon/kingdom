# Define the problem clearly
problem = "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13"

# Step-by-step solution
# Step 1: Isolate the variable term
# 2x + 5 = 13
# 2x = 13 - 5
# 2x = 8

# Step 2: Solve for x
# x = 8/2 = 4

x = (13 - 5) / 2
print(f"Solution: x = {x}")

# Verification
verification = 2 * x + 5
print(f"Verification: 2({x}) + 5 = {verification}")
print(f"Correct: {verification == 13}")

y = x**2 - 4*x + 3

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, y, 'b-', linewidth=2, label='y = x² - 4x + 3')
plt.axhline(y=0, color='k', linestyle='-', alpha=0.3)
plt.axvline(x=0, color='k', linestyle='-', alpha=0.3)

## Example Interactions

### Simple Calculation
User: "What is 15% of 240?"
Response: 
```
Problem Type: Arithmetic (Percentage)
Approach: Convert percentage to decimal and multiply

Step-by-step Solution:
1. Convert 15% to decimal: 15% = 15/100 = 0.15
2. Multiply by 240: 0.15 × 240 = 36

Python Code:
```python
percentage = 15
number = 240
result = (percentage / 100) * number
print(f"{percentage}% of {number} = {result}")
```

Final Answer: 36
```

### Complex Equation
User: "Solve the quadratic equation: x² - 5x + 6 = 0"
Response:
```
Problem Type: Algebra (Quadratic Equation)
Approach: Factoring method (can also use quadratic formula)

Step-by-step Solution:
1. Look for factors of 6 that add to -5: -2 and -3
2. Factor: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
3. Set each factor to zero: x - 2 = 0 or x - 3 = 0
4. Solve: x = 2 or x = 3

Python Code:
```python
import numpy as np

# Coefficients: x² - 5x + 6 = 0
a, b, c = 1, -5, 6

# Using quadratic formula
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
x1 = (-b + np.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
x2 = (-b - np.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)

print(f"Solutions: x = {x1} and x = {x2}")

# Verification
for x in [x1, x2]:
    result = x**2 - 5*x + 6
    print(f"For x = {x}: {x}² - 5({x}) + 6 = {result}")
```

Final Answer: x = 2 and x = 3
```

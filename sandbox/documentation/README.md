## File Structure

```
general_receiver/
â”œâ”€â”€ agent.py          # Main agent implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ prompts.txt       # AI prompts and personality guidelines  
â”œâ”€â”€ schema.json       # JSON schemas for inputs/outputs
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json       # Agent configuration and settings
â”œâ”€â”€ queries.sql       # Database queries for logging/analytics
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # This documentation file
```

## Configuration

### Runtime Settings (`config.json`)
- **Conversation History**: Maintains last 10 interactions by default
- **Response Timeout**: 30 seconds maximum for AI responses
- **Routing Enabled**: Automatic routing to specialist agents
- **Safety Level**: Medium content filtering
- **Gemini Model**: Uses gemini-pro for AI responses

### Routing Rules
The agent uses keyword-based routing with confidence thresholds:
- **Mathematical**: Keywords like "calculate", "solve", "equation" â†’ MathCalculator
- **Database**: Keywords like "sql", "query", "database" â†’ Tester agents  
- **Testing**: Keywords like "test", "validate", "verify" â†’ Testing agents
- **Strategic**: Keywords like "plan", "strategy", "decision" â†’ Vazir agent

## API Endpoints

### Main Chat Endpoint
```http
POST /api/chat
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sender": "user123",
  "receiver": "general_receiver",
  "forum": "support_channel", 
  "message": "What is the capital of France?"
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "The capital of France is Paris...",
  "agent_id": "general_receiver_001",
  "processing_time_ms": 1200,
  "workflow_id": "workflow_20250901_123456_abc123",
  "routed": false
}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. General Question
**Input**: "What is machine learning?"
**Response**: Provides comprehensive explanation of ML concepts, applications, and key algorithms.

### 2. Mathematical Routing
**Input**: "Can you calculate 15% compound interest on $5000 over 3 years?"
**Response**: "I'll connect you with our mathematical specialist who can provide precise calculations with step-by-step solutions."
**Action**: Routes to MathCalculator agent

### 3. Context Maintenance
**Input**: "What about its history?"
**Response**: (Referring to previous Paris discussion) "Paris has a rich history spanning over 2,000 years..."

### 4. Database Query Routing
**Input**: "How do I create a SQL table with foreign keys?"
**Response**: "I'll route your database question to our SQL specialist who can provide detailed schema examples."
**Action**: Routes to appropriate Tester agent

## Integration Points

### Kingdom Service Integration
- Inherits from `ServiceAgent` base class
- Integrates with Kingdom task queue system
- Uses existing A2A message bus infrastructure
- Leverages Kingdom logging and monitoring systems

### Database Integration
- Uses existing PostgreSQL connection pooling
- Stores conversations in `conversation_logs` table
- Tracks routing decisions in `routing_decisions` table
- Collects performance metrics in `agent_metrics` table

# Start Kingdom Management Server
python kingdom/management/management_server.py

# Test via curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sender": "test_user",
    "message": "Hello, can you help me with a math problem?"
  }'
```

### A2A Communication Testing
```python
# Test A2A messaging between agents
await general_receiver.send_a2a_message("math_calculator_001", {
    "type": "routed_request",
    "payload": {"message": "Calculate 2+2"},
    "return_address": "general_receiver_001"
})
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Monitor agent performance
curl http://localhost:8765/api/agents
curl http://localhost:8765/api/workflows
```

## Deployment Considerations

### Scaling
- Designed for high concurrent conversation loads
- Stateless design allows horizontal scaling  
- Conversation history stored in database, not memory
- Efficient routing algorithms minimize processing overhead

### Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Content safety filtering
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure credential management

### Monitoring

- Performance metrics for optimization
- Alert thresholds for proactive monitoring
- Health check endpoints for load balancers

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Context Learning**: Improve responses based on conversation patterns
- **User Personalization**: Adapt responses to individual user preferences
- **Advanced Routing**: ML-based routing decisions instead of keyword matching
- **Multi-language Support**: Handle conversations in multiple languages

### Integration Opportunities
- **Voice Interface**: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities
- **Rich Media**: Support for images, documents, and interactive content
- **External APIs**: Integration with search engines, knowledge bases
- **Workflow Automation**: Trigger complex multi-agent workflows
